# Caitlin's Personal Website

This website is a personal portfolio designed to showcase my programming skills, completed projects, and related work. It serves as a central hub for anyone interested in my technical background, offering easy access to project demos, source code, and contact information.

## What you'll find here

- A curated selection of programming projects with brief descriptions and links to source code or live demos.
- Summaries of skills and technologies used (languages, tools, frameworks).
- A short bio and contact information for networking or collaboration.
- Optional blog posts or notes about technical challenges, lessons learned, and tutorials.

## Purpose / Goals

- Present a clean, professional snapshot of my development work.
- Make it easy for collaborators or peers to review projects and run demos locally.
- Provide links to source repositories and clear instructions for reproducing work.

## Tech (typical)

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Frameworks: React, Vue, or similar
- Build tools: Webpack, Vite, or similar
- Hosting: GitHub Pages, Netlify, or custom server

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
